# Chapter-13-Searching-and-Sorting
<b>Chapter 13: Searching and Sorting</b><br/>
Ch012 file contains an iterative version of BinarySearch, a version of BubbleSort that sorts in descending order ,a version of SelectionSort that finds the max on each iteration of the loop but still gives ascending order ,and a version of QuickSort that uses a random index to pivot.These are all different ways of sorting data learned in Chapter 13. I read the textbook and researched which made it easier to work on these codes. The code also includes a Junit tester to test the code.
